<Warning>
The erlang SDK repository, and this docs site, are a work in progress. If you are trying to use Statsig in erlang or elixir, please reach out to our [support team](mailto:support@statsig.com), your sales contact, or in our [Slack community](https://statsig.com/slack).
</Warning>

[Github Repository](https://github.com/statsig-io/erlang-sdk)

## Installation

Add a dependency on statsig to your:

**mix.exs**:
```elixir
{:statsig, "~> 0.0.1"}
```

**rebar.config**:
```erlang
{statsig, "0.0.1"}.
```

**erlang.mk**:
```makefile
dep_statsig = hex 0.0.1
```

## Initialize the SDK

After installation, you will need to initialize the SDK using a [Server Secret Key from the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

<Warning>
Do NOT embed your Server Secret Key in client-side applications, or expose it in any external-facing documents. However, if you accidentally expose it, you can create a new one in the Statsig console.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```erlang Erlang
statsig:initialize(<<"secret-key">>).

% or with options
Options = #{environment => #{tier => <<"staging">>}},
statsig:initialize(<<"secret-key">>, Options).
```

```elixir Elixir
Statsig.initialize("secret-key")

# or with options
options = %{environment: %{tier: "staging"}}
Statsig.initialize("secret-key", options)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Working with the SDK

### Checking a Feature Flag/Gate

Now that your SDK is initialized, let's fetch a [**Feature Gate**](/feature-flags/overview). Feature Gates can be used to create logic branches in code that can be rolled out to different users from the Statsig Console. Gates are always **CLOSED** or **OFF** (think `return false;`) by default.

<CodeGroup>
```erlang Erlang
User = #{<<"userID">> => <<"user-id">>},
GateValue = statsig:check_gate(User, <<"gate_name">>).
```

```elixir Elixir
user = %{"userID" => "user-id"}
gate_value = Statsig.check_gate(user, "gate_name")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Reading a Dynamic Config

Feature Gates can be very useful for simple on/off switches, with optional but advanced user targeting. However, if you want to be able send a different set of values (strings, numbers, and etc.) to your clients based on specific user attributes, e.g. country, [**Dynamic Configs**](/dynamic-config) can help you with that.

<CodeGroup>
```erlang Erlang
Config = statsig:get_config(User, <<"config_name">>),
Value = statsig_config:get(Config, <<"param">>, <<"default">>).
```

```elixir Elixir
config = Statsig.get_config(user, "config_name")
value = StatsigConfig.get(config, "param", "default")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Getting a Layer/Experiment

Then we have **Layers/Experiments**, which you can use to run A/B/n experiments. We offer two APIs, but we recommend the use of [layers](/layers) to enable quicker iterations with parameter reuse.

<CodeGroup>
```erlang Erlang
Layer = statsig:get_layer(User, <<"layer_name">>),
ParamValue = statsig_layer:get(Layer, <<"param">>, <<"default">>).
```

```elixir Elixir
layer = Statsig.get_layer(user, "layer_name")
param_value = StatsigLayer.get(layer, "param", "default")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Logging an Event

Now that you have a Feature Gate or an Experiment set up, you may want to track some custom events and see how your new features or different experiment groups affect these events.

<CodeGroup>
```erlang Erlang
statsig:log_event(User, <<"event_name">>).
```

```elixir Elixir
Statsig.log_event(user, "event_name")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Statsig User

When calling APIs that require a user, you should pass as much information as possible in order to take advantage of advanced gate and config conditions (like country or OS/browser level checks), and correctly measure impact of your experiments on your metrics/events. At least one identifier, either userID or a Custom ID, is required to provide a consistent experience for a given user (as explained [here](/concepts/user#why-is-an-id-always-required-for-server-sdks)).

### Private Attributes

Have sensitive user PII data that should not be logged? No problem, we have a solution for it! On the StatsigUser object we also have a field called `privateAttributes`, which is a simple object/dictionary that you can use to set private user attributes. Any attribute set in `privateAttributes` will only be used for evaluation/targeting, and removed from any logs before they are sent to Statsig server.

## Shutdown

To gracefully shutdown the SDK and ensure all events are flushed:

<CodeGroup>
```erlang Erlang
statsig:shutdown().
```

```elixir Elixir
Statsig.shutdown()
```
</CodeGroup>
