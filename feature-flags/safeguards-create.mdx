description: Learn how to create a Safeguard on one or multiple targeting rules within a Feature Gate to monitor regressions and automatically take action when alerts fire.
---

You can create a Safeguard on one or multiple targeting rules within a Feature Gate. To create a Safeguard on a rule, follow the steps below:

1. Go to a Feature Gate's **Setup** tab

2. Pick a targeting rule for which you want to monitor regressions

3. Click the three-dot (...) menu and choose **'Safeguard Rule'**

4. Choose the action to take when alerts fire:
    - **Rollback to 0%** - Assign Default value to all users
    - **Roll out to 100%** - Assign Pass value to all users
    - **Pause Rollout** - Stop scheduled rollout progression (only available with active Schedule Rollout policy)

5. (Optional) Set how long to monitor alerts for safeguarding the rule:

    | Alert type | Evaluation period | Evaluation start time|
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Topline alert | Choose your own | Starts when the safeguard is created|
    | Rollout alert | Fixed (90 days) | Starts whenever targeting rule's pass % changes |

    <Tip>**Recommended:** Ideally you want to monitor topline alerts for crashes, errors, latency, etc. *for a few days* after a Feature Gate rollout to make sure things are stable. We recommend starting with a 14-day evaluation period.</Tip>

6. Select one or more alerts to monitor:

    - Rollout alerts - For feature-specific regression detection
    - Topline alerts - For system-wide health monitoring
