<Info title="Feature gates vs feature flags">
Statsig refers to feature flags as <em>feature gates</em> across the console and SDKs. The terms are interchangeable throughout this guide.
</Info>

Once your Statsig account is ready, follow the steps below to create and test-drive a new feature gate.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a feature gate">
    Navigate to the [Feature Gates page](https://console.statsig.com/gates) and click <strong>Get Started</strong> (or <strong>Create</strong> if you already have gates).

    ![Feature Gates page with Create button](/images/guides/first-feature/feature-gates-page.png)

    Give the gate a clear name and description—for example, <code>Mobile Registration</code> with a note about the new mobile sign-up flow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Target mobile platforms">
    New gates default to returning <code>false</code> until you add targeting. Click <strong>Add New Rule</strong>, choose <strong>Operating System → Any of</strong>, and select <strong>Android</strong> and <strong>iOS</strong>. Set the pass percentage to 100% and click <strong>Add Rule</strong>, then <strong>Save</strong>.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an internal testing rule">
    Layer on a second rule for your team—for example <strong>Email → Contains any of</strong> with your company domain—so employees can exercise the feature regardless of device.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate a client API key">
    Head to [Project Settings → API Keys](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys) and copy the <strong>Client API key</strong>. Keep server secret keys on backends only, and use console API keys for programmatic configuration work.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load the JavaScript SDK">
    <Tip title="Prefer a different SDK?">
    Statsig supports many platforms—see [Client SDK options](/) for alternatives. This walkthrough uses the browser SDK so you can experiment directly in DevTools.
    </Tip>

    Paste the snippet below into the browser console on any site to fetch the SDK from jsDelivr:

    ```js
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@statsig/js-client@3/build/statsig-js-client+session-replay+web-analytics.min.js';
    document.head.appendChild(script);
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize and check the gate">
    Replace <code>YOUR_SDK_KEY</code> with the client key from Step&nbsp;4 and run:

    ```js
    const client = new window.Statsig.StatsigClient('YOUR_SDK_KEY', {});
    await client.initializeAsync();
    ```

    Then call:

    ```js
    client.checkGate('mobile_registration');
    ```

    You should see <code>false</code> because the current session is not mobile and doesn’t use the employee email domain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Simulate a mobile environment">
    Enable the mobile device toolbar in Chrome DevTools.

    ![Chrome DevTools mobile device toolbar icon](/images/guides/first-feature/devtools-mobile-toolbar.png)

    Re-evaluate the user to pick up the new environment and re-check the gate:

    ```js
    await client.updateUserAsync({});
    client.checkGate('mobile_registration');
    ```

    The gate should now return <code>true</code> for the mobile profile.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the employee backdoor">
    Switch DevTools back to the desktop view and update the user with a company email:

    ```js
    await client.updateUserAsync({ email: 'teammate@statsig.com' });
    client.checkGate('mobile_registration');
    ```

    The gate passes again thanks to the email rule.

    ![Gate returning true via email rule](/images/guides/first-feature/email-rule-true.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Flush exposures and inspect diagnostics">
    ```js
    client.flush();
    ```

    Open the gate’s <strong>Diagnostics</strong> tab to confirm each exposure, including the failing desktop check, mobile pass, and employee pass.

    ![Diagnostics exposure stream showing recent checks](/images/guides/first-feature/diagnostics-stream.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use the gate in production

Wrap feature logic in a gate check so only targeted users see the experience:

```js
if (client.checkGate('mobile_registration')) {
  show(mobileRegistrationPage);
} else {
  show(oldRegistrationPage);
}
```

Happy feature gating!
