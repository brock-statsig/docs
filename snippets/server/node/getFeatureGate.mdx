## Retrieving Feature Gate Metadata

In certain scenarios, you may need more information about a gate evaluation than just a boolean value. For additional metadata about the evaluation, use the Get Feature Gate API, which returns a FeatureGate object:

```javascript
const gate = Statsig.getFeatureGate(user, 'new_homepage_design');
console.log(gate.name); // 'new_homepage_design'
console.log(gate.value); // true or false
console.log(gate.ruleID); // rule ID that was evaluated
console.log(gate.evaluationDetails); // evaluation metadata
```
