## Reading a Dynamic Config

Feature Gates can be very useful for simple on/off switches, with optional but advanced user targeting. However, if you want to be able send a different set of values (strings, numbers, and etc.) to your clients based on specific user attributes, e.g. country, [**Dynamic Configs**](/dynamic-config) can help you with that. The API is very similar to Feature Gates, but you get an entire json object you can configure on the server and you can fetch typed parameters from it. For example:

```javascript
const config = Statsig.getConfig(user, "awesome_product_details");

// The 2nd parameter is the default value to be used in case the given parameter name does not exist on
// the Dynamic Config object. This can happen when there is a typo, or when the user is offline and the
// value has not been cached on the client.
const itemName = config.get("product_name", "Awesome Product v1");
const price = config.get("price", 10.0);
const shouldDiscount = config.get("discount", false);
```
