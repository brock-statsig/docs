## Logging an Event

Now that you have a Feature Gate or an Experiment set up, you may want to track some custom events and see how your new features or different experiment groups affect these events. This is super easy with Statsig - simply call the Log Event API and specify the user and event name to log; you additionally provide some value and/or an object of metadata to be logged together with the event:

```javascript
Statsig.logEvent(user, "add_to_cart", "SKU_12345", {
  price: "9.99",
  item_name: "diet_coke_48_pack",
});
```

Learn more about identifying users, group analytics, and best practices for logging events in the [logging events guide](/guides/logging-events).
