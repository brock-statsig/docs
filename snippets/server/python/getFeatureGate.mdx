## Retrieving Feature Gate Metadata

In certain scenarios, you may need more information about a gate evaluation than just a boolean value. For additional metadata about the evaluation, use the Get Feature Gate API, which returns a FeatureGate object:

```python
gate = statsig.get_feature_gate(StatsigUser("user-id"), "gate-name")
print(gate.name)  # 'gate-name'
print(gate.value)  # True or False
print(gate.rule_id)  # rule ID that was evaluated
print(gate.evaluation_details)  # evaluation metadata
```
