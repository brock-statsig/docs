## Logging an Event

Now that you have a Feature Gate or an Experiment set up, you may want to track some custom events and see how your new features or different experiment groups affect these events. This is super easy with Statsig - simply call the Log Event API and specify the user and event name to log; you additionally provide some value and/or an object of metadata to be logged together with the event:

```python
from statsig.statsig_user import StatsigUser
from statsig.statsig_event import StatsigEvent

statsig.log_event(StatsigEvent(StatsigUser("user-id"), "event-name"))
```

Python supports `retry_queue_size`, which allows you to adjust the memory allocated for handling retries. 
While service outages are rare, increasing the retry_queue_size can help minimize event loss by providing additional memory to buffer events during such occurrences. 
This option is generally not needed for typical use but offers added flexibility in exceptional situations.

Learn more about identifying users, group analytics, and best practices for logging events in the [logging events guide](/guides/logging-events).
