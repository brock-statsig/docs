After installation, you will need to initialize the SDK using a [Server Secret Key from the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

<Warning>
Do NOT embed your Server Secret Key in client-side applications, or expose it in any external-facing documents. However, if you accidentally expose it, you can create a new one in the Statsig console.
</Warning>

There is also an optional parameter named `options` that allows you to pass in a [StatsigOptions](#statsig-options) to customize the SDK.

```python
from statsig import statsig

statsig.initialize("server-secret-key")

# or with StatsigOptions
options = StatsigOptions(tier=StatsigEnvironmentTier.development)
statsig.initialize("server-secret-key", options)

# check if sdk is initialized
initialized = statsig.is_initialized()
```

`initialize` will perform a network request. After `initialize` completes, virtually all SDK operations will be synchronous (See [Evaluating Feature Gates in the Statsig SDK](https://blog.statsig.com/evaluating-feature-gates-in-the-statsig-sdk-a6f8881a1ad8)). The SDK will fetch updates from Statsig in the background, independently of your API calls.
