## Statsig User

The `StatsigUser` object represents a user in Statsig. You must provide a `userID` or at least one of the `customIDs` to identify the user.

### Private Attributes

Private attributes are user attributes that are used for evaluation but are not forwarded to any integrations. They are useful for PII or sensitive data that you don't want to send to third-party services.
