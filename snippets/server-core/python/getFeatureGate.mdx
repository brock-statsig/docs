## Retrieving Feature Gate Metadata

In certain scenarios, you may need more information about a gate evaluation than just a boolean value. For additional metadata about the evaluation, use the Get Feature Gate API, which returns a FeatureGate object:

```python
gate = statsig.get_feature_gate(user, "example_gate")
print(gate.rule_id)
print(gate.value)
```
