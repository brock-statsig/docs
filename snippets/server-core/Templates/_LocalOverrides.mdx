## Local Overrides

To override the return value of a gate/config/experiment/layer locally, we expose a set of override APIs. Coupling this with [StatsigOptions.disable_network](#statsig-options) can be helpful when writing unit tests.

{/* Local override code snippets should be included here */}

<Note>
1. These only apply locally - they do not update definitions in the Statsig console or elsewhere.
2. The local override API is not designed to be a full mock. They are only a convenient way to override the value of the gate/config/etc.
