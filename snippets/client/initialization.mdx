Next, initialize the SDK with a client SDK key from the ["API Keys" tab on the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys). These keys are safe to embed in a client application.

<Warning>While client keys are safe to include, Server and Console keys should always be kept private.</Warning>

Along with the key, pass in a [User Object](#statsig-user) with the attributes you'd like to target later on in a gate or experiment.
